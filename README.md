An interactive visual audio "game" about randomness and control.

You can test it here:

harmonicblender.mus.auth.gr:7777

Works better on Chrome or (less better) Safari - not at all good at Firefox because of an issue in how Firefox waits to "listen" to how the audiofiles behave, regardless of their playing status.
